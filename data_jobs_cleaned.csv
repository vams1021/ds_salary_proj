The Data Scientist will support our two main products: EX Program and This is Quitting.
The EX Program® is Truth Initiative’s enterprise-level digital tobacco cessation program designed for employers, health systems, and health plans. Developed in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, it builds on the highly successful consumer platform, EX, launched in 2008 that has helped nearly 1 million tobacco users on their quitting journey. The EX Program is designed for tobacco users across the motivational continuum. It supports users through multiple, integrated modalities which include a website with an online social network, dynamically tailored text messaging fully integrated with the website, email, synchronous live chat digital coaching, and pharmacotherapy decision support and delivery. We provide value to our clients by helping their employees/members live healthier lives and demonstrating that value through a variety of reporting mechanisms.
This is Quitting is Truth Initiative’s vaping cessation text message program designed specifically for teens and young adults. To date, nearly 600,000 young people have enrolled in This is Quitting and results from a randomized trial show that it is the first – and only – intervention to help young e-cigarette users quit. Since we launched the program in January 2019, we have contracted with state and local governments, school systems, health plans, and other youth-serving organizations to deliver a customized and co-branded version of This is Quitting as well as comprehensive reporting about program uptake, engagement, and outcomes among the young people they serve.
